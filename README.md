# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots üöóüìä

##  Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone Challenge organized by the Consulting and Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati. The goal is to implement a dynamic pricing model for urban parking lots to optimize revenue while considering demand, occupancy, and other environmental factors. The solution predicts the ideal hourly price for each parking lot using key features such as time of day, location, and utilization.

üîç Architecture and Workflow
Data Loading and Cleaning:
The dataset was loaded from CSV files, cleaned for null values, incorrect entries, and formatted for consistency.

Feature Engineering:
We extracted and engineered relevant features such as:

Day of week and hour of day

Parking duration and occupancy

Historical pricing trends

Model Building:
After trying linear models and tree-based methods, XGBoost Regressor gave the best performance with optimized hyperparameters.

Evaluation Metrics:
The model was evaluated using:

R-squared (R¬≤)

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

Output:
Final predictions were generated for hourly pricing and visualized using line plots for select parking lots.
